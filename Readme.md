# Tree Planting Initiative

## Vision
The Tree Planting Initiative aims to incentivize individuals and organizations to plant trees by providing them with a transparent platform that records and rewards tree planting activities. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can ensure that every tree planted is accounted for, verified, and rewarded, thus promoting environmental sustainability on a decentralized level.

## Features
- **Proof Submission**: Users can submit a proof of planting a tree (e.g., location, photo metadata) to be recorded on the blockchain.
- **Verification Process**: Authorized entities can verify the planting proofs to ensure they are legitimate.
- **Reward Distribution**: Planters receive rewards in cryptocurrency upon successful verification of the tree planting.

## Contract Address
- **Network**: Aptos Devnet
- **Contract Address**: 0x8bdc7a88a3e9bfed69f81bcfe2f20a01b9a997fdcb04324a0c5b036b92e18ead

## How It Works
1. **Submit Proof of Planting**:
   - Users can submit proof of their tree planting through the `submit_proof` function, which takes a description of the tree planting (e.g., GPS location or metadata).
   - The proof is then stored on the blockchain.

2. **Verification and Reward**:
   - Authorized verifiers can use the `verify_and_reward` function to validate the planting.
   - Once verified, a reward (in cryptocurrency) is distributed to the planterâ€™s account.

## Future Scope
- **Decentralized Verification**: Implement a decentralized verification system to allow multiple stakeholders to participate in the verification process, thereby enhancing transparency and credibility.
- **Gamification**: Introduce gamification features such as leaderboards, badges, and community challenges to motivate users to plant more trees.
- **Integration with Carbon Credit Market**: Link verified tree planting records with carbon credit markets to provide additional incentives for planters.
- **Mobile Application**: Develop a user-friendly mobile application for seamless submission of proof, tracking progress, and viewing rewards.
- **Partnership with NGOs**: Partner with environmental NGOs to expand the reach of the initiative and ensure accurate and efficient verification processes.

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies for the Aptos blockchain.
- Deploy the contract using your preferred deployment tool.
- Once deployed, users can interact with the smart contract to submit tree planting proofs and receive rewards after verification.
